# Base Image: CentOS 7 - https://hub.docker.com/_/centos
#
# CentOS images with a major version number are rolling builds, for example centos:6 or centos:7.
# These images will be updated monthly or as needed for emergency fixes.
# Therefore a build based on a major-tagged CentOS base image does not produce the same environment with every build.
#
# Images with minor version tags DO NOT recieve updates as they are intended to
# match installation iso contents, for example centos:7.1.1503 or centos:6.7.
# If a minor-tagged image is used, when including "yum -y update" or "yum -y install <something>" in the Dockerfile,
# the system also updates with the latest packages and so the final image might also differs every time.
#
# When triggered, this Dockerfile always uses the latest CentOS 7 base image and updates.

# Set default timezone.
# An alternative way to set timezone is to run container with: -e "TZ=Continent/City".
ENV TZ America/Los_Angeles

# When a package is downloaded, installed and removed there is a chance that
# the package may still be saved/stored in the yum's cache. So to clean all the
# cached packages run "yum clean all" at the end of an image building.
